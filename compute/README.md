## How to run all samples

1. Get this package and all dependencies.

  ```bash
  export PROJECT=github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples/compute
  go get -u $PROJECT
  cd ${GOPATH}/src/${PROJECT}
  dep ensure
  ```
1. Create an Azure service principal with the [Azure CLI][] command `az ad sp
   create-for-rbac --output json` and set the following environment variables
   per that command's output. You can also copy `.env.tpl` to `.env` and fill
   it in; the configuration system will utilize this.

  ```bash
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=
  AZURE_TENANT_ID=
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
  AZURE_BASE_GROUP_NAME=
  AZURE_LOCATION_DEFAULT=westus2
  ```

1. TODO(joshgav): grant this principal all-powerful rights to your AAD tenant to faciliate identity-related operations.
1. Run the tests: `go test -v -timeout 12h`

  The timeout is optional, but some tests take longer than then default 10m to complete.
